        <h2>Hi everyone, <br/><br/>
          We decided to name the group “Fantastic boys” after a thorough discussion. There are two reasons why we choose this special name. Firstly, all team members are boys, which is a coincidence while forming the team as we have just known one another for roughly few weeks ago. The other reason is that we choose this name to show respect. Moreover, this is our first project that we would try our best.
          <br/><br/>
          Show your L<span>&hearts;</span>VE if you like this website.
          <br/><br/>
          <p>(NOTICE: The site is only suitable for 18-year-olds :P)</p>
          <p><span style="text-align:right; color:#000000; font-size:18px;">* No matter what u say, that gal is sorta cute.</span></p>

	<h1>COPYRIGHT</h1>
  <li>Copyright is a legal right that protects original works of authorship (e.g., music, videos, etc.). Generally, copyright protects an original expression of an idea (e.g., the specific way a video or music is expressed or created) but does not protect underlying ideas or facts.

Copyright Infringement

We do not allow any content that infringes copyright. The use of copyrighted content of others without proper authorization or legally valid reason may lead to a violation of InstaKilogram's policies.

At the same time, not all unauthorized uses of copyrighted content constitute an infringement. In many countries, exceptions to copyright infringement allow the use of copyrighted works under certain circumstances without authorization. These include the fair use doctrine in the United States and permitted acts of fair dealing in the European Union (and other equivalent exceptions under applicable local laws in other countries).

Removal of Content; Suspension or Termination of Account

Any user content that infringes an other person’s copyright may be removed. The account may be suspended or terminated for multiple copyright violations in connection with the use of the InstaKilogram site or app, or other violations of the Terms of Service and Community Guidelines. We reserve the right to refuse any account holder whose account was used for improper activities from opening a new account on InstaKilogram’s site or app, or otherwise hosted by InstaKilogram.

Information for Rightsholders:

Copyright Infringement Notification

Contacting the user directly may resolve your complaint more quickly and in a way that is more beneficial to you, the user, and our community. You may also file a Copyright Infringement Report to request the removal of the alleged infringing content from InstaKilogram.

All complaints should contain the information requested in our online Copyright Infringement Report form. Failure to include necessary information may limit our ability to investigate your claims and may result in your complaint being denied.

We may provide the account holder with your contact information, including the email address and the name of the copyright owner, and/or details of the complaint.</li>
