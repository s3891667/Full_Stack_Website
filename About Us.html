  <h2>Hi everyone, <br/><br/>
    We decided to name the group “Fantastic boys” after a thorough discussion. There are two reasons why we choose this special name. Firstly, all team members are boys, which is a coincidence while forming the team as we have just known one another for roughly few weeks ago. The other reason is that we choose this name to show respect. Moreover, this is our first project that we would try our best.
